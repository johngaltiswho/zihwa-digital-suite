# Monorepo to Multi-Repo Migration Strategy

## Current Structure (Optimized for Separation)

### Apps (Loosely Coupled)
```
apps/
├── invero/              # FinTech platform
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json     # Independent dependencies
│   └── .env.local       # App-specific config
├── fluvium-site/        # E-commerce brand A
├── aacpinfra-site/      # Services brand B
└── zihwafoods-site/     # E-commerce brand C
```

### Shared Packages (Extractable)
```
packages/
├── ui/                  # → Can become @zihwa/ui npm package
├── auth/                # → Can become auth service
├── database/            # → Can become shared database utils
├── payment/             # → Can become payment service
└── types/               # → Can become @zihwa/types
```

### Services (Future Microservices)
```
services/
├── api/                 # → Can become separate API service
├── auth/                # → Can become auth microservice
└── notifications/       # → Can become notification service
```

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Monorepo (0-6 months)
- Build all apps in monorepo
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Rapid development
- Cost: $50-100/month total

### Phase 2: Selective Separation (6-12 months)
- Extract Invero first (regulatory needs)
- Keep e-commerce apps together
- Cost: $150-250/month

### Phase 3: Full Separation (12+ months)
- Each brand becomes independent
- Shared services as APIs
- Cost: $300-500/month (but with revenue to support)

## Separation Triggers

### Extract When:
- ✅ App generates >$10K/month revenue
- ✅ Regulatory compliance becomes complex
- ✅ Team size >5 people for that app
- ✅ Investment/acquisition interest
- ✅ Different scaling requirements

### Keep Together When:
- ✅ Apps share 80%+ of functionality
- ✅ Same team managing all
- ✅ Similar business models
- ✅ Cost savings >$200/month

## Technical Separation Plan

### Database Strategy
```typescript
// Current: Logical separation
const inveroDb = createClient(process.env.INVERO_DB_URL)
const fluviumDb = createClient(process.env.FLUVIUM_DB_URL)

// Future: Physical separation
// Each app gets its own database instance
```

### Authentication Strategy
```typescript
// Current: Shared auth with tenancy
const auth = createAuth({
  tenant: 'invero' | 'fluvium' | 'aacp'
})

// Future: Separate auth services
// Or shared auth as microservice
```

### API Strategy
```typescript
// Current: Namespaced routes
/api/invero/projects
/api/fluvium/products
/api/aacp/services

// Future: Separate API services
// https://api.invero.com/projects
// https://api.fluvium.com/products
```

## Cost Analysis

### Monorepo Costs (Current)
```
Vercel Pro: $20/month
Database: $25/month
Auth: $10/month
Storage: $15/month
Total: $70/month for ALL apps
```

### Separated Costs (Future)
```
Per App:
- Hosting: $20/month
- Database: $25/month
- Auth: $10/month
- Storage: $10/month
Total: $65/month × 4 apps = $260/month
```

### Break-even Analysis
```
Separation makes sense when:
- Combined revenue >$5K/month
- Or regulatory requirements mandate it
- Or team conflicts arise
```

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Ensure each app has independent config
2. Separate database schemas/instances
3. Namespace all shared code
4. Document inter-app dependencies

### Step 2: Extract First App (Invero)
1. Copy /apps/invero to new repo
2. Extract needed packages
3. Update import paths
4. Deploy to new infrastructure
5. Update DNS/domains

### Step 3: Extract Remaining Apps
1. Repeat process for each app
2. Shared packages become npm packages
3. Shared services become APIs
4. Maintain backward compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Dependency Hell**: Use exact versions, lock files
- **Breaking Changes**: Semantic versioning for shared packages
- **Data Migration**: Plan database migrations carefully

### Business Risks
- **Downtime**: Blue-green deployments
- **Cost Spikes**: Gradual migration with monitoring
- **Team Confusion**: Clear documentation and communication

## Success Metrics

### Stay Together If:
- Development velocity >80% of separated
- Bug rate <1 critical bug/month affecting multiple apps
- Team satisfaction >7/10
- Cost savings >$150/month

### Separate If:
- Revenue per app >$10K/month
- Regulatory pressure increases
- Team conflicts arise
- Performance issues spread across apps

## Conclusion

Start with monorepo for speed and cost efficiency, but architect for separation from day one. This gives you the best of both worlds: rapid development now, flexibility later.
